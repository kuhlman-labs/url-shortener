# Kuhlman-Labs URL Shortener

This is a simple URL shortener that I wrote in Go. It uses a SQLite database to store the URLs and their shortened versions. The server is written using the `net/http` package and the database is accessed using the `database/sql` package. The frontend is written in Go's html/template package.
